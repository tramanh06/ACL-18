    <mainText>Transitioning, a society dedicated towards helping retrenched professional, manager, executive and technical (PMET) class workers published in its website about the plight of an Singaporean Indian man, Mohan. The 53-year-old upgraded his skills by taking up the WSH Safety coordinator course, but even with the skills upgrading he found it difficult to land a job because of language barriers. He said: “Till date I am struggling to find a job as a safety coordinator. I have send more than 100 applications and attended 5 interviews. I was rejected as I can’t speak Mandarin or due to my age.” Mohan added that he had over 7 years’ of experience in the construction industry but that employers choose to employ foreigners over Singaporeans in the sector because they would be tied down for a long period in the job and are also cheap. — If you have jobs for such PMETs, please contact Transitioning at gilbert@transitioning.org.  </mainText>
